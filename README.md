# Arducam Mega Zephyr Driver

## Usage

Add to your `west.yml` manifest:

```yaml
manifest:
  projects:
    # RTC Driver
    - name: arducam
      url: https://github.com/arribada/arducam-zephyr-driver
      revision: master
      path: arducam
```

This will import the driver and allow you to use it in your code.

Additionally make sure that you run `west update` when you've added this entry to your `west.yml`.

### Configuration

Add this entry to your `.conf`

```conf
# RTC
CONFIG_COUNTER=y
CONFIG_ARDUCAM=y
```

### Overlay

Here is an example of defining the PCF85063A in your `.overlay`

```json
&i2c1 {
 compatible = "nordic,nrf-twim";
 status = "okay";

 pinctrl-0 = <&i2c1_default>;
 pinctrl-1 = <&i2c1_sleep>;
 pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
 pcf85063a: pcf85063a@51 {
  compatible = "nxp,pcf85063a";
  reg = <0x51>;
 };
};
```

### Import

For time set/get you will need to include:

```c
#include <zephyr/drivers/counter.h>
#include <drivers/counter/pcf85063a.h>
```

### Import

You can get the device by it's node label, for example:

```c
#define RTC DEVICE_DT_GET(DT_NODELABEL(pcf85063a))

const struct device *const rtc = RTC;

static void rtc_init() {
  /* Check device readiness */
  if (!device_is_ready(rtc)) {
    LOG_ERR("pcf85063a isn't ready!");
  }
  ...
};
```
